On the mentioned operating systems packages are provided by the project, a installation from source
is not recommended. On all platforms all updates should be applied before installation. Using the
Puppetlabs Repository providing an up-to-date version of Puppet is required which of the supported
versions to use is based on user requirements.

Some plugins especially Katello will limit the available plattform.

# Requirements - Puppet & Facter

* Only All-in-one packaging model from Puppet is supported for Puppet 7
 * Puppet 6 is technically still supported, but EOL
 * Older Puppet versions are not supported
 * Puppet Enterprise is not supported
* Puppetserver gets telemetry disabled by default
* Structured Facts are used by default

~~~SECTION:handouts~~~

****

Puppet 7 is supported with current versions for All-in-one packaging standard by Puppet.
Support for Puppet 6 was not dropped yet, but this version has reached end of life, older versions are no longer supported.
Puppet Enterprise is not supported, but can work with manual tweaking of the setup.

~~~PAGEBREAK~~~

Puppetserver gets installed as central component and since the Foreman project wants to respect userâ€™s privacy,
it disables the telemetry introduced by Puppetserver by default. You can opt-in if you want.

Structured facts are used by default, so no need for legacy facts anymore.
