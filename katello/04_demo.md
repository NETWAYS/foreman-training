Setting up Katello is only a bit more challenging then Foreman, but the team provides an
easy way to create a demo setup.

Requirements:

* git
* vagrant (libvirt or virtualbox provider)

The repository https://github.com/Katello/katello-deploy/ includes everything else you need.
Simply clone it with git, use vagrant to provide a Katello server.

The trainer will give you some time to get yourself familiar with Katello.
Some ideas to try out:

* Sync content like the Foreman Client or EPEL repository
* Create a Lifecycle environment
* Create some content views, use filters, composite content views, publishing and promotion
* Create activation keys, incorporate host collections, register hosts

Ask for assistance and discuss your ideas if anything is unclear.
