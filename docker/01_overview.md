Docker is an Open Source Project written in Go and released in March 2013 to help
with packaging software as containers and deploying them in development and production
in the same fashion. Docker also provides its own community plattform to share containers.

Container virtualization runs an application container consisting of one application with
all its required resources like code, runtime, system tools and system libraries on a host's
kernel as isolated process in the user space restricted by resource limitations.
